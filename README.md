Originally assigned problem ( Computer Vision course - CSCI-6368 -- Spring 2016 -- UTRGV )

Assuming you have all the coin change denomination (i.e. cents, nickels, dimes, and quarters) with no major overlap, take a picture of the coin change and use Hough Circle detecting from OpenCV to detect the circles in the image and count the amount of change in the picture.

a.	You can use the size (and any other relationships) among the coins to figure out the amount of change.
b.	You can use the color to distinguish the cents from the others if the radius of the cents and dimes are too close.
c.	If you need to, you can also assume that you have a picture of each coin separately on the same background.
d.	Try the same amount of coin change with some overlap. Do you still get the same result?
