Originally assigned problem ( Computer Vision course - CSCI-6368 -- Spring 2016 -- UTRGV )

Assuming you have all the coin change denomination (i.e. cents, nickels, dimes, and quarters) with no major overlap, take a picture of the coin change and use Hough Circle detecting from OpenCV to detect the circles in the image and count the amount of change in the picture.
#
a.	You can use the size (and any other relationships) among the coins to figure out the amount of change.
#
b.	You can use the color to distinguish the cents from the others if the radius of the cents and dimes are too close.
#
c.	If you need to, you can also assume that you have a picture of each coin separately on the same background.
#
d.	Try the same amount of coin change with some overlap. Do you still get the same result?
